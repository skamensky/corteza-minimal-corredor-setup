# What

A simple POC for setting up corredor server in [corteza](https://github.com/cortezaproject/corteza-server).
Include a workflow that interacts with a corredor script. The corredor script updates corteza.

See my [forum post](https://forum.cortezaproject.org/t/show-corteza-a-poc-github-repo-for-corredor-server/1058) for a bit of additional context.

# Why

I’ve notice that a lot of people are struggling to set up corredor server.

I also struggled. In the end I got it working (after many hours of debugging and mucking around docker).

To save future community member time and sweat, I’ve created a github repository which enabled you to easily start up an instance of corteza with the corredor server running.
